## SLIDE 3: LEARNING #1 - WHEN TRANSFERS FAIL, TRUST COLLAPSES

**Title:** Learning #1: When Transfers Fail, Trust Collapses Immediately

**Subtitle:** Users don't tolerate uncertainty. A single failed transfer can turn a promoter into a detractor.

**Data Points (3 boxes):**
- **38.8%** of negative verbatims mention instability or failures
- **24.1%** gave Muy baja satisfacción (unusually high)
- **22.5%** Bre-B success rate during Dec incident

**User Quotes:**
- "I've tried more than 5 times to transfer money from my account to Bold and I can't" ⭐1
  - *Original: "he intentado mas de 5 veces trasladar plata de mi cuenta a Bold y no puedo"*

- "Sometimes the app fails when sending via Bre-B" ⭐5
  - *Original: "a veces la app falla en los envíos por Bre-B"*

**Insight Box:**
The bimodal distribution (54% Muy alta satisfacción, 24% Muy baja satisfacción) shows an "all or nothing" experience. When Bre-B works, users love it. When it fails, they feel abandoned. **Reliability IS the product.**

---

## SLIDE 4: LEARNING #2 - USERS FEEL ABANDONED WHEN ERRORS OCCUR

**Title:** Learning #2: Users Feel Abandoned When Errors Occur

**Subtitle:** Generic error messages create anxiety. Users don't know what went wrong or what to do next.

**Data Points:**
- **17.2%** of negative verbatims cite "transfer failure"
- **0** verbatims mention clear error guidance

**User Quotes:**
- "There's a persistent block on my Nu account against my Nequi account and they don't give me a solution" ⭐1
  - *Original: "persiste un bloqueo en mi cuenta de Nu contra mi cuenta de Nequi y no me dan solución"*

- "Sometimes I get lost on the first screen, I don't know where I have the account registered" ⭐1
  - *Original: "a veces me pierdo en la primera pantalla, no sé dónde tengo inscrita la cuenta"*

**UX Gap Identified:**
When transfers fail, users receive error messages like "La cuenta receptor no cumple con las validaciones requeridas" without context on what to do. They're left guessing, retrying, and eventually giving up.

---

## SLIDE 5: LEARNING #3 - 4x1000 TAX CREATES FRICTION

**Title:** Learning #3: The 4x1000 Tax Creates "Surprise" Friction

**Subtitle:** Colombia's unique transaction tax generates frustration because users lack visibility and control.

**Data Points:**
- **~107** verbatims mention 4x1000
- **4.5%** of all improvement requests

**User Quotes:**
- "I'd like to know how much I've sent this month to know when I'll reach the 4x1000 monthly cap" ⭐1
  - *Original: "quisiera poder conocer en mi cuenta cuanto he enviado en el mes para saber cuando llegaré al tope de 4x1000 mensual"*

- "Between accounts of the same person, 4x1000 shouldn't be charged — why are you charging it?" ⭐4
  - *Original: "se supone que entre cuentas de la misma persona no se cobra el 4x1000, por qué lo están cobrando?"*

**Competitive Opportunity:**
No major bank in Colombia provides real-time visibility of accumulated 4x1000. Building this tracker could be a **significant differentiator** — turning a regulatory pain point into a trust-building feature.

---

## SLIDE 6: LEARNING #4 - SPEED IS THE #1 DRIVER OF SATISFACTION

**Title:** Learning #4: Speed is the #1 Driver of Trust and Satisfaction

**Subtitle:** When transfers are instant, users feel confident. Any delay creates doubt.

**Data Points:**
- **53.9%** gave Muy alta satisfacción (very satisfied)
- **11.6%** of positive verbatims mention "efficiency"

**User Quotes (positive):**
- "Honestly 10/10 for Bre-B" ⭐5
  - *Original: "la verdad 10/10 el bre-b"*

- "Fast and simple process" ⭐5
  - *Original: "Proceso rápido y sencillo"*

- "Everything is easy, fast, and efficient" ⭐5
  - *Original: "todo es fácil, rápido y eficiente"*

**What's Working:**
When Bre-B works as intended, users describe it as "instant," "agile," and "reliable." The core transfer experience is solid — the challenge is **maintaining consistency**.

---

## SLIDE 7: LEARNING #5 - SMALL UX FRICTIONS ACCUMULATE

**Title:** Learning #5: Small UX Frictions Accumulate Into Frustration

**Subtitle:** Users notice when flows aren't optimized, even if they complete successfully.

**Data Points:**
- **195** verbatims ask to "simplify the process"
- **8.2%** of all improvement requests

**4 UX Issues Identified:**

1. **🔙 Post-Transfer Navigation**
   "When I finish a transfer and I'm at the receipt, I have to go back through ALL the steps to get home."

2. **🔑 Keys Management**
   "I can't edit or delete saved keys. I don't know which bank a key belongs to until the end."

3. **🔐 Confirmation Friction**
   "Do I need to enter my password for EVERY transfer? I already registered with Face ID."

4. **📱 QR from Gallery**
   "I want to scan QR codes from photos saved in my phone gallery, not just live camera."

**Quick Wins Available:**
Many of these are **low-effort, high-impact fixes**: add a "Go to Home" button, show bank name for keys, allow Face ID for confirmation.

## SLIDE 8: BRAZIL & MEXICO LEARNINGS

**Title:** Cross-Geo Insights: Learnings from Brazil & Mexico

**Subtitle:** Patterns and best practices from more mature markets

**Brazil (Pix) - 4 learnings:**

| Learning | Applicability to CO |
|----------|---------------------|
| Speed = Trust pattern confirmed (90%+ CSAT when instant) | ✅ High |
| Favorites/Frequents management improvements moved satisfaction up | ✅ High |
| Face ID/fingerprint for confirmation reduced friction | 🟡 Medium |
| "Transfer = Send only" mental model confirmed in research | ✅ High |

**Mexico (SPEI) - 4 learnings:**

| Learning | Applicability to CO |
|----------|---------------------|
| Stability issues created same bimodal distribution | ✅ High |
| Generic errors like "operation failed" generated anxiety | ✅ Critical for CO |
| "Invite a friend" prompts after transfers annoyed users | 🟡 Medium |
| Auto bank detection was a common request | ✅ High |

---

## SLIDE 9: CROSS-GEO PATTERN COMPARISON

**Title:** UX Pattern Comparison Across Markets

**Table:**

| UX Pattern | Brazil (Pix) | Mexico (SPEI) | Colombia (Bre-B) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Speed = Trust | ✅ Confirmed | ✅ Confirmed | ✅ Confirmed |
| Favorites Management Gap | 🟡 Present | 🟡 Present | 🔴 Critical |
| Error Message Clarity | 🟡 Improving | 🔴 Gap | 🔴 Critical Gap |
| Post-Transfer Navigation | ✅ Optimized | 🟡 Improving | 🔴 Gap |
| Tax/Fee Transparency | N/A | N/A | 🔴 4x1000 Gap |

**Universal Truths:**
- **Speed = Trust** — Instant confirmation is #1 driver in all markets
- **Instability destroys trust immediately** — One bad experience turns promoters into detractors
- **Error handling is a major gap** — Users feel abandoned when things go wrong
- **"Transfer = Send"** — Users conceptualize transfers as sending, not receiving

**Colombia-specific:** The 4x1000 tax creates unique friction not present in BR/MX.

## SLIDE 10: DETRACTORS DEEP DIVE - OVERVIEW

**Title:** Understanding Users Who Rated 1 or 2

**Big Number (centered, red):**
**995** Users gave Muy baja or Baja satisfacción
(25.3% of all respondents — abnormally high)

**Alert Banner:**
⚠️ **Correlation with December 2025 Incidents**
This CSAT was collected in January 2026, immediately following major Bre-B incidents in December:

---

## SLIDE 11: DETRACTOR PAIN #1 - TRANSFER FAILURES

**Title:** Pain Category #1: Transfer Failures & Instability

**Percentage:** 38.8% of detractor complaints

**What Users Experienced:**
Transfers that failed silently, repeated attempts without success, app freezes during transactions, uncertainty about whether money was actually sent. Many users report trying 3-5+ times.

**User Quotes:**
- "I've tried more than 5 times to transfer money and I can't" ⭐1
- "Sometimes it takes a while, it's not fast and you don't know if the transfer was made or not" ⭐4

**UX Impact:**
Users don't just lose the transaction — they lose confidence in using Nu for any financial operation. Several verbatims mention considering switching to other banks.

---

## SLIDE 12: DETRACTOR PAIN #2 - ACCOUNT BLOCKS

**Title:** Pain Category #2: Account Blocks & No Resolution

**Percentage:** ~5% of detractor complaints

**What Users Experienced:**
Persistent blocks, particularly for Nu ↔ Nequi transfers, that haven't been resolved despite reaching out to support. Users feel stuck and ignored.

**User Quotes:**
- "There's a persistent block on my Nu account against my Nequi account and they don't give me a solution" ⭐1
- "How is it possible that I can't pay taxes with this account?? And I can't make large movements either" ⭐2

**UX Impact:**
Creates a feeling of being "trapped" — they have money in Nu but can't send it where they need. Especially frustrating for users who relied on Nu as their primary account.

---

## SLIDE 13: DETRACTOR PAIN #3 - 4x1000 CONFUSION

**Title:** Pain Category #3: 4x1000 Confusion & Frustration

**Percentage:** ~15% of detractor complaints

**What Users Experienced:**
Users feel "surprised" by 4x1000 deductions. They can't track accumulated tax, don't understand exemption rules, and question charges they believe shouldn't apply.

**User Quotes:**
- "Every time I make a transfer, regardless of the amount, 4x1000 is deducted" ⭐1
- "According to a decree, 4x1000 shouldn't be charged if you don't exceed an amount, but they're deducting it from me" ⭐3

**UX Impact:**
Creates perception that Nu is "taking extra money" or not being transparent. Some users avoid Nu for large transfers specifically because of 4x1000 uncertainty.

---

## SLIDE 14: DETRACTOR PAIN #4 - PROCESS TOO LONG

**Title:** Pain Category #4: Process Too Long & Confusing

**Percentage:** ~10% of detractor complaints

**What Users Experienced:**
Too many taps to complete a transfer, difficulty finding where contacts are saved, confusing navigation after completing a transfer.

**User Quotes:**
- "It's too long to make the payment, too many steps to pay" ⭐2
- "When I make a transfer and I'm at the receipt part, I have to go back through all the steps to get to the beginning" ⭐1

**UX Impact:**
The transfer completes, but friction makes users feel the product is "not as good as other banks" and erodes premium perception.

---

## SLIDE 15: KEY DETRACTOR INSIGHT

**Title:** The Common Thread Among Detractors

**Main Insight (large text):**
Detractors feel a **LOSS OF CONTROL**

**Explanation:**
Whether it's a failed transfer, an unexplained block, a surprise tax deduction, or a confusing flow — they don't understand what's happening and can't fix it themselves.

**The Opportunity:**
Improving error communication, providing self-service recovery options, and adding 4x1000 visibility could significantly reduce detractor volume in future waves.
